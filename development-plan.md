# Development Plan — Schedica

## How to use this file

Each phase is a self-contained development step. Work through them **in order** — each phase depends on the previous one being complete. Do not skip ahead.

At the start of each phase, reference the relevant feature doc from the `features/` folder. At the end of each phase, the app should be in a working, testable state before moving to the next.

**Relevant docs:** All feature specs live in `features/`

**Done when:** All tables exist in the database, migrations are tracked, and Drizzle Studio shows all tables correctly.

---

## Phase 2 — Landing Page

**Goal:** Full public-facing marketing page is live. Visitors can understand the product, see pricing, and sign up.

### Tasks

**Layout & Navigation:**
- [ ] Public layout (separate from app layout — no sidebar, no auth)
- [ ] Sticky nav bar with logo, nav links, Sign In + Get Started CTAs
- [ ] Mobile hamburger menu
- [ ] Smooth scroll to section on anchor link click

**Sections (in order):**
- [ ] Hero — headline, subheadline, primary CTA ("Get Started Free"), hero image
- [ ] Social proof bar — e.g. "Used by freelancers and growing teams"
- [ ] Features section — 6 cards (Smart Booking Links, Calendar Sync, Custom Questions, Reminders, Video Conferencing, Meetings Dashboard)
- [ ] How It Works — 4 steps (Sign Up → Connect Calendar → Create Event Type → Share Link)

- [ ] `robots.txt`

**Done when:** Landing page is fully built, all sections render, legal pages exist, and Sign In / Get Started buttons link to auth pages.

---

## Phase 3 — Authentication

**Goal:** Users can sign up, sign in, sign out, verify email, and reset password. Google and Microsoft OAuth work.

**Reference doc:** [features/user-onboarding.md](./features/user-onboarding.md)

### Tasks

**Better Auth setup:**
- [ ] Configure Better Auth in `src/lib/auth/config.ts`
  - Email + password provider
  - Google OAuth provider
  - Microsoft OAuth provider
  - Admin Plugin
  - Drizzle adapter
  - Session config (7-day TTL, 30-day with "remember me")
- [ ] Mount Better Auth handler at `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`
- [ ] Configure Resend as the email provider for Better Auth
- [ ] Create Better Auth client in `src/lib/auth/client.ts`

**Pages:**
- [ ] `/sign-up` — sign up form (name, email, password) + Google / Microsoft OAuth buttons
- [ ] `/sign-in` — sign in form (email, password, remember me checkbox) + OAuth buttons
- [ ] `/forgot-password` — email input form
- [ ] `/reset-password` — new password + confirm password (reads token from URL)
- [ ] `/verify-email` — handles code from email, shows success or expired error

**Logic:**
- [ ] On sign-up: send email verification via Resend
- [ ] On Google/Microsoft OAuth: skip email verification (already verified by provider)
- [ ] On password reset: revoke all existing sessions
- [ ] Redirect authenticated users away from auth pages → `/dashboard`
- [ ] Protect all `(dashboard)` routes — unauthenticated users redirected to `/sign-in`
- [ ] Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` — session check on every protected route

**Email templates (via Resend):**
- [ ] Email verification email (link valid 24 hours)
- [ ] Password reset email (link valid 1 hour, single-use)
- [ ] Welcome email (after first successful sign-up)

**Done when:** A new user can fully sign up, verify email, sign in (email + OAuth), reset password, and sign out. All auth pages are styled consistently.

---

## Phase 4 — User Onboarding

**Goal:** New users are guided from sign-up to their first live booking link in under 3 minutes.

**Reference doc:** [features/user-onboarding.md](./features/user-onboarding.md)

### Tasks

- [ ] `/onboarding` route — protected, only accessible if user has no event types yet
- [ ] Onboarding wizard layout with step indicator (Step 1 of 5)
- [ ] **Step 1 — Profile Setup**
  - [ ] Name (pre-filled from OAuth if available)
  - [ ] Profile photo upload (optional, skip button)
  - [ ] Username / booking URL slug (auto-suggested from name, editable, uniqueness check)
- [ ] **Step 2 — Connect Calendar**
  - [ ] Connect Google Calendar button → OAuth flow
  - [ ] Connect Outlook / Office 365 button → OAuth flow
  - [ ] Connect Apple Calendar button → App-specific password flow
  - [ ] "Skip for now" option (can connect later in Settings)
  - [ ] Show connected calendar with green checkmark after auth
- [ ] **Step 3 — Set Timezone**
  - [ ] Searchable timezone dropdown (IANA timezones)
  - [ ] Auto-detect from browser with confirmation ("We detected: Asia/Kolkata — is this correct?")
- [ ] **Step 4 — Create First Event Type**
  - [ ] Name input (default: "30-Minute Meeting")
  - [ ] Duration selector (15 / 30 / 45 / 60 min)
  - [ ] Location type selector (Zoom / Google Meet / Phone / In-Person)
- [ ] **Step 5 — Preview & Share**
  - [ ] Live preview of the booking page (iframe or component)
  - [ ] Copy booking link button
  - [ ] "Go to Dashboard" button
- [ ] If user already has event types: redirect away from `/onboarding` to `/dashboard`

**Done when:** A new user after sign-up is guided through all 5 steps and arrives at their dashboard with a working, shareable booking link.

---

## Phase 5 — User Profile & Settings

**Goal:** Hosts can manage their profile, timezone, notification preferences, and account security.

**Reference doc:** [features/user-profile-settings.md](./features/user-profile-settings.md)

### Tasks

**API Routes / Server Actions:**
- [ ] Update profile (name, display name, bio, job title, company, website URL)
- [ ] Upload / remove profile photo
- [ ] Update timezone
- [ ] Update notification preferences
- [ ] Change password (requires current password)
- [ ] Enable / disable 2FA (TOTP via Better Auth)
- [ ] List active sessions
- [ ] Revoke individual session
- [ ] Revoke all other sessions
- [ ] Update username / booking URL slug (with uniqueness check in real-time)
- [ ] Delete account (with confirmation — type email to confirm)
- [ ] Request GDPR data export (triggers pg-boss job → ZIP via Vercel Blob → email download link within 24h)

**UI (`/settings/`):**
- [ ] `/settings/profile` — name, display name, bio, photo, job title, company, website
  - [ ] Live booking page preview on right side as user edits
- [ ] `/settings/timezone` — timezone picker with current time preview
- [ ] `/settings/notifications` — toggle per notification type (booking, reminder, cancellation, reschedule)
  - [ ] From name and reply-to email customization
- [ ] `/settings/security` — change password, 2FA setup *(Phase 2)*, active sessions list with revoke buttons *(Phase 2)*
- [ ] `/settings/integrations` — connected calendars + video platforms (links to Phase 8 and Phase 13)
- [ ] Username change input with real-time uniqueness check and 30-day redirect creation
- [ ] "Download my data" button → triggers GDPR export job, shows "You'll receive an email within 24 hours"
- [ ] Danger zone: Delete account with confirmation modal

**Done when:** All profile fields update and persist correctly. Photo upload works. Username change creates a redirect. GDPR export request triggers a job and sends an email.

---

## Phase 6 — Event Type Builder

**Goal:** Hosts can create, edit, duplicate, hide, and delete event types. Each generates a unique booking link.

**Reference doc:** [features/event-types.md](./features/event-types.md)

### Tasks

**API Routes / Server Actions:**
- [ ] Create event type
- [ ] Get event types for current user
- [ ] Get event type by id
- [ ] Update event type (all fields)
- [ ] Duplicate event type
- [ ] Toggle hide/show event type
- [ ] Delete event type
- [ ] Reorder event types (drag-and-drop position)
- [ ] Check slug uniqueness (per user)

**UI (`/event-types/`):**
- [ ] Event types list page — cards with name, duration, location icon, active/hidden badge, booking link, action menu
- [ ] Create event type button → opens builder
- [ ] Event type builder page `/event-types/new` and `/event-types/[id]/edit`:
  - [ ] **What** tab: name, description, duration (preset + custom), color picker
  - [ ] **Where** tab: location type selector — Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, Phone, In-Person address, Custom link
  - [ ] **When** tab: availability schedule selector, booking window, minimum notice, buffer before/after, daily limit
  - [ ] **Options** tab: URL slug, hide from profile, booking confirmation message, redirect URL after booking
  - [ ] Multi-duration option: toggle "Let invitees choose duration" → add multiple durations
  - [ ] Live preview panel showing how the booking page will look
  - [ ] Save + Publish button
- [ ] Copy booking link button on each event type card
- [ ] Context menu on each card: Edit, Duplicate, Hide, Delete

**Done when:** Event types can be created, edited, duplicated, and hidden. Each event type generates a correct URL at `schedica.com/[username]/[slug]`.

---

## Phase 7 — Availability Management

**Goal:** Hosts can set weekly working hours, buffer times, booking limits, and date-specific overrides.

**Reference doc:** [features/availability-management.md](./features/availability-management.md)

### Tasks

**API Routes / Server Actions:**
- [ ] Get availability schedule for current user
- [ ] Update weekly availability rules (per day: enabled, startTime, endTime)
- [ ] Add multiple time blocks per day (e.g., 9am–12pm and 2pm–5pm)
- [ ] Set buffer time before / after meetings
- [ ] Set minimum notice period
- [ ] Set maximum booking window
- [ ] Set daily meeting limit
- [ ] Get date overrides (specific blocked dates or custom hours)
- [ ] Add date override (block a date or set custom hours for a date)
- [ ] Delete date override

**UI (`/availability/`):**
- [ ] Weekly availability grid — toggle days on/off, set start/end time per day
- [ ] Add multiple time blocks per day (+ Add time range button)
- [ ] Buffer settings: before meeting / after meeting dropdowns (0 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 30 / 60 min)
- [ ] Minimum notice selector (e.g., 1 hour / 2 hours / 1 day / 2 days)
- [ ] Booking window selector (e.g., 14 days / 30 days / 60 days / Indefinite)
- [ ] Daily meeting limit input (None or number)
- [ ] Start time increment selector (every 15 / 30 / 60 minutes)
- [ ] Booking window type toggle: Rolling (e.g., next 30 days) vs Fixed date range (select start + end date)
- [ ] Date overrides section:
  - [ ] Calendar view to pick specific dates
  - [ ] Mark date as fully unavailable (blocked)
  - [ ] Set custom hours for a specific date
  - [ ] Bulk block a date range (e.g., vacation Jan 15–22) via calendar range picker
  - [ ] List of upcoming overrides with edit / delete
- [ ] Save changes button with success toast

**Done when:** Weekly availability rules save correctly and overrides block specific dates. The booking page for an event type reflects all rules accurately.

---

## Phase 8 — Calendar Integrations

**Goal:** Hosts can connect Google, Outlook, and Apple calendars. Schedica reads free/busy data in real-time and writes new bookings.

**Reference doc:** [features/calendar-integrations.md](./features/calendar-integrations.md)

### Tasks

**Google Calendar:**
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 flow — `GET /api/calendars/google/connect` → redirect to Google consent
- [ ] OAuth callback — `GET /api/calendars/google/callback` → exchange code for tokens, save to `connected_calendars`
- [ ] Fetch calendar list from Google Calendar API
- [ ] User selects which calendars to check for conflicts + which to write new bookings to
- [ ] Read free/busy data via `calendar.freebusy.query`
- [ ] Write new bookings via `calendar.events.insert`
- [ ] Token refresh logic (access token expires every 1 hour)
- [ ] Disconnect Google Calendar → delete tokens from DB

**Microsoft Outlook / Office 365:**
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 flow via Microsoft Graph API
- [ ] Callback handler — save tokens to `connected_calendars`
- [ ] Read free/busy via `/me/calendarView`
- [ ] Write bookings via `/me/events`
- [ ] Token refresh logic
- [ ] Disconnect Outlook

**Apple iCloud / CalDAV:**
- [ ] App-specific password form (no OAuth for Apple)
- [ ] CalDAV connection using provided credentials
- [ ] Read calendar events via CalDAV REPORT request
- [ ] Write bookings via CalDAV PUT request
- [ ] Disconnect Apple Calendar

**Free/Busy Caching:**
- [ ] `sync-calendar` pg-boss job — runs every 10 minutes per connected calendar
- [ ] Cache free/busy windows in `calendar_events_cache`
- [ ] Booking engine reads from cache first, falls back to live API call

**UI (`/settings/integrations/`):**
- [ ] Connected calendars section:
  - [ ] Google: "Connect Google Calendar" button → OAuth flow
  - [ ] Outlook: "Connect Outlook" button → OAuth flow
  - [ ] Apple: App-specific password form
  - [ ] Each connected calendar shows: account email, calendars checked for conflicts, write-target calendar, "Disconnect" button
- [ ] Per-calendar toggles: which calendars to include in conflict check

**Done when:** Connecting Google Calendar allows Schedica to read free/busy data and write bookings. Token refresh works silently. Disconnect cleans up all stored tokens.

---

## Phase 9 — Timezone Management

**Goal:** Host and invitee always see meeting times in their own local timezone — automatically and accurately.

**Reference doc:** [features/timezone-management.md](./features/timezone-management.md)

### Tasks

**Host Timezone:**
- [ ] Timezone stored on `users` table (IANA identifier, set during onboarding)
- [ ] All dashboard times rendered in host timezone
- [ ] All host-side calendar writes use host timezone
- [ ] Timezone change in settings: recalculate future availability display, keep past bookings in UTC

**Invitee Timezone:**
- [ ] Auto-detect via `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` on booking page load
- [ ] Manual timezone override — dropdown shown on booking page ("Showing times in: Asia/Kolkata ▾")
- [ ] Store detected/selected timezone with the booking record

**Slot Calculation:**
- [ ] Availability windows stored as `HH:mm` strings paired with the schedule's IANA timezone (e.g., `09:00`–`17:00` in `Asia/Kolkata`) — NOT converted to UTC, to handle DST correctly
- [ ] All booking `startTime` / `endTime` stored as UTC timestamps in the database
- [ ] Slot generation: expand `HH:mm` windows into UTC ranges using `date-fns-tz` → subtract busy events → return available slots
- [ ] Slot generation uses `date-fns-tz` for DST-safe conversion to invitee timezone
- [ ] Slots display in invitee local time on booking page
- [ ] Confirmation screen shows both: invitee time AND host time

**Emails:**
- [ ] Confirmation email to invitee: "Your time: Thu Jun 5 at 3:00 PM IST" + "Host's time: 10:00 AM EST"
- [ ] Notification email to host: meeting time shown in host's timezone
- [ ] Reminder emails to invitee: invitee timezone shown

**Done when:** An invitee in IST booking a host in EST sees correct local times on the booking page, confirmation screen, and all emails. DST transitions do not cause off-by-one hour errors.

---

## Phase 10 — Public Booking Page

**Goal:** The public-facing booking page is live at `schedica.com/[username]/[eventSlug]`. Invitees can browse and select available time slots.

**Reference doc:** [features/booking-page-customization.md](./features/booking-page-customization.md)

### Tasks

**Profile Overview Page (`/[username]`):**
- [ ] Server-rendered page (no auth required)
- [ ] Host photo, name, bio, job title
- [ ] All active (non-hidden) event type cards
- [ ] Each card: name, duration, location icon, short description, "Book" button
- [ ] If one event type: option to redirect directly (skip profile overview)

**Event Type Booking Page (`/[username]/[eventSlug]`):**
- [ ] Server-rendered page (no auth required)
- [ ] Host info in left panel (photo, name, event type name, duration, location, description)
- [ ] Date picker (calendar) in center — grayed-out unavailable dates, highlighted available dates
- [ ] Time slot grid — available slots listed for selected date in invitee's timezone
- [ ] Timezone selector shown below slot list ("Showing times in: Asia/Kolkata ▾")
- [ ] "No slots available" message for fully booked dates

**Booking Page Customization:**
- [ ] Host brand color applied as accent color on booking page
- [ ] Host profile photo shown (circular avatar)
- [ ] Custom welcome / confirmation message shown after booking
- [ ] "Powered by Schedica" badge (shown on free plan, hidden on paid)

**Performance:**
- [ ] Slot calculation is done server-side (Server Component or API route)
- [ ] Static metadata (host info, event type) pre-rendered
- [ ] Slots reload only when a new date is selected (no full page reload)

**Done when:** The booking page is publicly accessible, shows correct available slots for the next 30 days, respects all availability rules, and is mobile-responsive.

---

## Phase 11 — Booking Engine

**Goal:** The core booking processor — slot locking, conflict check, calendar write, and all post-booking jobs.

**Reference doc:** [features/booking-engine.md](./features/booking-engine.md)

### Tasks

**Rate Limiting on Public Booking Endpoints:**
- [ ] Apply `@upstash/ratelimit` on `GET /api/slots` — 30 requests/min per IP
- [ ] Apply `@upstash/ratelimit` on `POST /api/bookings` — 5 bookings/hour per IP, 3/hour per invitee email
- [ ] Return `X-RateLimit-*` headers on all rate-limited responses
- [ ] Validate email format with Zod before any DB write
- [ ] Block known disposable email domains

**API Route: `POST /api/bookings`**
- [ ] Validate request body with Zod (eventTypeId, startTime, inviteeName, inviteeEmail, inviteeTimezone, answers)
- [ ] Acquire PostgreSQL advisory lock for the slot (prevents concurrent double-booking)
- [ ] Re-verify slot availability inside a DB transaction (final check)
- [ ] Insert booking record into `bookings` table
- [ ] Release advisory lock
- [ ] Enqueue post-booking pg-boss jobs (inside same transaction):
  - [ ] `generate-video-link` — create Zoom / Google Meet link
  - [ ] `write-calendar-event` — add event to host's connected calendar
  - [ ] `send-confirmation` — send confirmation emails to host + invitee
  - [ ] `schedule-reminders` — schedule 24h and 1h reminder jobs
- [ ] Return booking confirmation data to client

**pg-boss Workers:**
- [ ] `generate-video-link` worker — calls Zoom or Google Meet API, updates booking record with video URLs
- [ ] `write-calendar-event` worker — creates calendar event on host's calendar with .ics invite
- [ ] `send-confirmation` worker — sends confirmation emails via Resend
- [ ] `schedule-reminders` worker — schedules two future pg-boss jobs (24h and 1h before start)

**Booking Status Flow:**
- [ ] `confirmed` — successfully booked
- [ ] `pending_payment` — awaiting payment (Phase 3)
- [ ] `cancelled` — cancelled by host or invitee
- [ ] `rescheduled` — rescheduled (original booking links to new one)
- [ ] `no_show` — host marked invitee as no-show

**Slot Lock Expiry:**
- [ ] If payment/form processing takes > 5 minutes — lock expires and slot is released

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Slot already taken → return clear error + list alternative available slots
- [ ] Video API failure → booking still confirmed, host notified to add link manually
- [ ] Calendar write failure → retry via pg-boss (3 retries with exponential backoff)
- [ ] Email failure → retry via pg-boss (3 retries)

**Done when:** Concurrent booking attempts for the same slot cannot both succeed. Post-booking jobs run async and do not block the API response. Failed jobs retry automatically.

---

## Phase 12 — Custom Questions

**Goal:** Hosts can add custom intake questions to their booking form. Invitees answer them before confirming.

**Reference doc:** [features/custom-questions.md](./features/custom-questions.md)

### Tasks

**API Routes / Server Actions:**
- [ ] Get questions for an event type
- [ ] Add question to event type
- [ ] Update question (label, type, options, required, position)
- [ ] Delete question
- [ ] Reorder questions (drag-and-drop position)
- [ ] Save booking answers with the booking record

**Question Types:**
- [ ] Short text (single-line, 255 char limit)
- [ ] Long text / paragraph (multi-line, 2000 char limit)
- [ ] Phone number (with country code selector, format validation)
- [ ] Single select (radio buttons)
- [ ] Multi select (checkboxes)
- [ ] Dropdown (select from list)
- [ ] Number input

**UI — Host (Event Type Builder → Questions tab):**
- [ ] Questions list with drag-and-drop reorder
- [ ] "Add Question" button → opens question type picker
- [ ] Question editor: label, type, required toggle, options editor (for select/dropdown)
- [ ] Delete question with confirmation

**UI — Invitee (Booking Form):**
- [ ] Questions rendered after name + email fields, before confirm button
- [ ] Required fields marked with asterisk (*), validated on submit
- [ ] Phone field shows country code selector

**Answers Storage:**
- [ ] Answers saved to `booking_answers` table on booking creation
- [ ] Answers included in host notification email
- [ ] Answers visible in Meetings Dashboard booking detail view

**Auto-Remember for Repeat Invitees:**
- [ ] On email field blur during booking: query `bookings` table for previous bookings by same host + same invitee email
- [ ] If found: pre-fill question answers from most recent booking into form fields
- [ ] Show notice: "We've pre-filled your answers from a previous booking. Update anything that has changed."
- [ ] Invitee can edit any pre-filled answer before submitting

**Done when:** Hosts can add, reorder, and delete questions. Invitees see and answer them during booking. Answers are stored and visible in the dashboard. Repeat invitees see pre-filled answers.

---

## Phase 13 — Video Conferencing

**Goal:** Every booking automatically gets a unique video link for the host and a join link for the invitee.

**Reference doc:** [features/video-conferencing.md](./features/video-conferencing.md)

### Tasks

> ⚠️ **Zoom Marketplace Approval — Do This First**
> The Zoom API requires a published, approved OAuth app in the Zoom Marketplace before it works for all users. Submit the app for review early — approval takes **2–4 weeks** and requires a live privacy policy, terms of service, and a working demo. During development, use a **development-mode** Zoom OAuth app (works for up to 100 connected users, no approval needed). Switch to the published app before launch.

**Zoom Integration:**
- [ ] Register Zoom OAuth app in Zoom Marketplace (development mode first)
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 connection: `GET /api/video/zoom/connect` → redirect to Zoom OAuth
- [ ] Callback: `GET /api/video/zoom/callback` → exchange code, save tokens
- [ ] `generate-video-link` worker: call `POST /v2/users/me/meetings` via Zoom API
  - [ ] Unique meeting ID + passcode per booking
  - [ ] Meeting title = event type name + invitee name
  - [ ] Duration = booking duration
- [ ] Store `videoLinkHost` (start URL) and `videoLinkInvitee` (join URL) on booking record
- [ ] Token refresh logic
- [ ] Disconnect Zoom from settings

**Google Meet Integration:**
- [ ] Google Meet link generated via `conferenceData` on Google Calendar event creation
- [ ] No separate OAuth needed — uses Google Calendar access already granted in Phase 8
- [ ] Extract Meet link from calendar event `conferenceData.entryPoints`

**Microsoft Teams Integration:**
- [ ] Teams meeting created via Microsoft Graph API `POST /me/onlineMeetings`
- [ ] No separate OAuth needed — uses Microsoft Graph access from Phase 8
- [ ] Extract Teams join link from response

**UI (`/settings/integrations/`):**
- [ ] Video platforms section:
  - [ ] Zoom: "Connect Zoom Account" button → OAuth → connected state with account email
  - [ ] Google Meet: auto-available if Google Calendar is connected (no extra auth needed)
  - [ ] Microsoft Teams: auto-available if Outlook is connected
- [ ] Event type builder — location type selector shows connected platforms only

**Done when:** Selecting Zoom in an event type creates a unique Zoom meeting per booking. Google Meet and Teams links are generated automatically from existing calendar connections.

---

## Phase 14 — Booking Confirmation

**Goal:** Invitee sees a confirmation screen instantly after booking. Both parties receive confirmation emails with calendar invites.

**Reference doc:** [features/booking-confirmation.md](./features/booking-confirmation.md)

- [ ] **Host time** — same meeting in host's timezone (shown directly below invitee time)
- [ ] Duration
- [ ] Location (video join button or address)
- [ ] "A confirmation has been sent to [email]" message
- [ ] Add to Calendar buttons — Google Calendar, iCal/Outlook, Office 365

**Confirmation Email — Invitee (via Resend):**
- [ ] Subject: "Confirmed: [Event Type Name] with [Host Name]"
- [ ] Invitee time + host time (both timezones)
- [ ] Video join link (or address)
- [ ] Calendar download buttons (Google, iCal)
- [ ] Invitee's own form answers (for their reference)
- [ ] Reschedule link + Cancel link
- [ ] Host's custom confirmation message (if set)
- [ ] `.ics` file attached (generated via `ical-generator`)

**Notification Email — Host (via Resend):**
- [ ] Subject: "New booking: [Invitee Name] — [Date + Time]"
- [ ] Invitee name + email
- [ ] Meeting time in host's timezone
- [ ] Video join link (host's start link for Zoom)
- [ ] All booking form answers
- [ ] Cancel booking link

**Calendar Event (via Phase 8 calendar connection):**
- [ ] Host calendar event created with: title, start/end, location (video link or address), invitee as attendee, description with form answers
- [ ] ICS invite sent to invitee via email attachment

**Done when:** Invitee sees the confirmation screen immediately after booking. Both parties receive confirmation emails with correct timezones. Calendar invite is attached to invitee email.

---

## Phase 15 — Notifications & Reminders

**Goal:** Automated 24-hour and 1-hour email reminders are sent to invitees before every meeting. All lifecycle events trigger correct emails.

**Reference doc:** [features/notifications-reminders.md](./features/notifications-reminders.md)

### Tasks

**pg-boss Job Scheduling:**
- [ ] On booking created — schedule four future jobs:
  - [ ] `reminder_24h` — fires 24 hours before `startTime`
  - [ ] `reminder_1h` — fires 1 hour before `startTime`
  - [ ] `followup` — fires 30 minutes after `endTime` *(Phase 2)*
  - [ ] `noshow_check` — fires 15 minutes after `startTime` *(Phase 2)*
- [ ] Each job uses `singletonKey` = `{bookingId}_{jobType}` — ensures one job per booking per type
- [ ] On booking cancelled — cancel all pending reminder jobs by `singletonKey`
- [ ] On booking rescheduled — cancel old jobs, schedule new jobs with updated times

**pg-boss Workers:**
- [ ] `send-reminder.ts`:
  - [ ] Fetch booking + host + invitee details
  - [ ] Confirm booking is still `confirmed` (skip if cancelled/rescheduled)
  - [ ] Send reminder email to invitee via Resend
  - [ ] Invitee time + host time in email (both timezones)
  - [ ] Video join link prominently displayed
  - [ ] Reschedule and cancel links in footer
- [ ] Transactional email workers (fire immediately, not scheduled):
  - [ ] `send-booking-confirmation` — to invitee (triggered on booking creation — Phase 14)
  - [ ] `send-host-notification` — to host (triggered on booking creation — Phase 14)
  - [ ] `send-cancellation-notification` — to both parties (Phase 17)
  - [ ] `send-reschedule-notification` — to both parties (Phase 17)

**Email Templates (Resend):**

- [ ] Cancellation notice — invitee (when invitee or host cancels)
- [ ] Cancellation notice — host (when invitee cancels)
- [ ] Reschedule confirmation — invitee
- [ ] Reschedule confirmation — host
- [ ] Host cancellation notice — invitee (when host cancels from dashboard)

**Customization:**
- [ ] Host can set: from name, reply-to email (stored in `notification_preferences`)
- [ ] All emails use host's from name (e.g., "Jane Smith" not "Schedica")
- [ ] Custom confirmation message injected into invitee confirmation email

**Done when:** Reminder jobs are scheduled when a booking is created, cancelled when booking is cancelled, and fire correctly at 24h and 1h before the meeting. All reminder emails include both timezones and the join link.

---

## Phase 16 — Meetings Dashboard

**Goal:** Hosts can view, search, filter, and manage all their bookings from a central dashboard.

**Reference doc:** [features/meetings-dashboard.md](./features/meetings-dashboard.md)

### Tasks

**API Routes / Server Actions:**
- [ ] Get upcoming meetings (paginated, sorted by soonest first)
- [ ] Get past meetings (paginated, sorted by most recent first)
- [ ] Get meeting detail (with booking answers, notes)
- [ ] Search meetings by invitee name or event type
- [ ] Filter meetings by status, event type, date range
- [ ] Add / update private notes on a booking
- [ ] Cancel meeting from dashboard (host-initiated)
- [ ] Stats: total meetings this month, upcoming count, cancellation rate

**UI (`/dashboard/`):**
- [ ] **Today's Meetings** section at top — highlighted, with countdown to next meeting, one-click join button (active 15 min before start)
- [ ] **Upcoming Meetings** list — sorted by date, grouped by day ("Tomorrow", "Thursday, June 5", etc.)
- [ ] **Past Meetings** tab — sorted most recent first
- [ ] Meeting card shows: invitee name + photo initials, event type, date + time (host timezone), duration, location icon, status badge (Confirmed / Rescheduled / Cancelled), Join button
- [ ] Click meeting card → open booking detail panel (slide-in):
  - [ ] All booking details (time, both timezones, location, invitee email)
  - [ ] Invitee's form answers
  - [ ] Private notes textarea (host-only, not visible to invitee)
  - [ ] Cancel meeting button
  - [ ] Payment status (Phase 3)
- [ ] Search bar — filter by invitee name in real-time
- [ ] Filter dropdown — by event type, status
- [ ] Stats bar at top: Upcoming / This Month / Cancellation Rate
- [ ] Empty state for each tab ("No upcoming meetings — share your booking link to get started")

**Done when:** Dashboard shows all meetings correctly. Today's meetings are highlighted. Search and filters work. Private notes save. Join button activates 15 minutes before meetings.

---

## Phase 17 — Cancellation & Reschedule

**Goal:** Invitees can cancel or reschedule bookings via links in their emails. Hosts can cancel from the dashboard.

**Reference doc:** [features/booking-flow.md](./features/booking-flow.md)

### Tasks

**API Routes:**
- [ ] `GET /api/bookings/[token]/cancel` — load cancellation page (validate token)
- [ ] `POST /api/bookings/[token]/cancel` — process cancellation
- [ ] `GET /api/bookings/[token]/reschedule` — load reschedule page (shows booking page with new slot picker)
- [ ] `POST /api/bookings/[token]/reschedule` — confirm reschedule (new start time)

**Cancellation Flow:**
- [ ] Unique cancel token per booking (stored on `bookings` table)
- [ ] Cancel page: shows meeting details, cancellation reason field (free text or host-configured dropdown options), "Cancel Meeting" button
- [ ] Store cancellation reason on `bookings.cancellationReason` column
- [ ] Cancellation policy enforcement — if within locked window: show **Cancellation Blocked** page with: heading, explanation of window, host contact email, add-to-calendar button (booking stays confirmed)
- [ ] Reschedule Blocked page: same design as Cancellation Blocked — shown when reschedule window is also locked
- [ ] On cancel: update booking status to `cancelled`, cancel all pg-boss reminder jobs, remove from host's calendar, send cancellation emails to both parties

**Reschedule Flow:**
- [ ] Unique reschedule token per booking
- [ ] Reschedule page: shows full booking page (same as original event type) with available slots
- [ ] Original time shown at top: "You are rescheduling from: Thu Jun 5, 3:00 PM IST"
- [ ] On reschedule: cancel old booking, create new booking with same invitee details, cancel old pg-boss jobs, schedule new jobs, send reschedule emails to both parties
- [ ] Rescheduled booking links to previous via `rescheduledFromId`

**Host Cancellation (from Dashboard):**
- [ ] "Cancel Meeting" button in booking detail panel
- [ ] Cancellation reason input (sent to invitee)
- [ ] On cancel: same flow as invitee cancellation + notification to invitee

**Cancellation Policy:**
- [ ] Host sets policy on event type: allowed always / no cancellations within X hours
- [ ] Policy enforced on both invitee cancel link and host dashboard cancel

**Done when:** Invitees can cancel and reschedule via email links. Hosts can cancel from the dashboard. Cancellation and reschedule emails send correctly. Calendar events are removed on cancellation.

---

## Phase 18 — Billing & Plan Enforcement

**Goal:** Plan limits are enforced server-side on every relevant action. Upgrade prompts appear when limits are hit. Admin can configure plans. Public pricing page fetches data from the API.

**Reference doc:** [features/billing.md](./features/billing.md)

### Tasks

**Database seed (plans already in schema from Phase 1):**
- [ ] Seed `plans` table: Free, Standard, Pro/Teams (name, displayName, monthlyPriceUsd, annualPriceUsd, status, orderIndex)
- [ ] Seed `plan_limits` for each plan: custom_questions, date_overrides_per_month, booking_history_days
- [ ] Seed `plan_feature_flags` for each plan: branding_removal, custom_email_from, analytics, webhooks, payments
- [ ] Seed `plan_bullets` (marketing bullet points per plan for pricing page)
- [ ] Assign all existing users to Free plan in `user_plans` on first migration

**Plan Enforcement Utility:**
- [ ] `getActivePlan(userId)` — reads `user_plans`, resolves override if non-expired
- [ ] `checkLimit(userId, limitKey)` → `{ allowed, current, max }` — used before any limit-gated action
- [ ] `checkFeatureFlag(userId, featureKey)` → boolean — used before feature-gated actions
- [ ] Enforce `custom_questions` limit on question add API
- [ ] Enforce `date_overrides_per_month` on date override create API
- [ ] Enforce `branding_removal` flag on booking page render (server component)
- [ ] Enforce `custom_email_from` flag on notification preference save

**API Routes:**
- [ ] `GET /api/plans` — public, no auth — returns all active plans with limits, flags, and bullets (for pricing page)
- [ ] `GET /api/user/plan` — returns current user's plan + usage stats
- [ ] `GET /api/user/usage` — returns current usage vs plan limits

**Upgrade Prompt:**
- [ ] On `PLAN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` API error (403): frontend shows upgrade modal
- [ ] Modal shows: which limit was hit, what the next plan includes, [View Plans] + [Upgrade Now] buttons
- [ ] [Upgrade Now] links to `/settings/billing` (full implementation Phase 3 — Stripe)

**UI:**
- [ ] `/settings/billing` — current plan name, usage stats per limit, "Upgrade" button (disabled in MVP, links to contact)
- [ ] Pricing page (`/pricing`) fetches from `GET /api/plans` dynamically — not hardcoded

**Admin Plan Config (in Phase 19 Admin Panel):**
- [ ] `/admin/plans` — list all plans with Edit buttons
- [ ] `/admin/plans/:id/edit` — edit pricing, limits, feature flags, bullet points, visibility
- [ ] `GET/PATCH /api/admin/plans/:id` — admin plan update endpoints
- [ ] `PATCH /api/admin/plans/:id/bullets` — reorder/add/remove bullets
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/users/:id/plan-override` — set manual plan override for a user
- [ ] `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id/plan-override` — remove override

**Done when:** Free plan users cannot add more than 3 questions; upgrade prompt appears when they try. Pricing page renders from the API. Admin can edit plan limits without a code deployment.

---

## Phase 19 — Admin Panel

**Goal:** Platform admins can manage users, view bookings, monitor job queues, and configure the platform via Orbit Admin.

### Tasks

**Access Control:**
- [ ] `/admin` route group — check `is_platform_admin = true` via Better Auth Admin Plugin, else redirect to `/`
- [ ] All `/api/admin/*` routes return 403 for non-platform-admins

**Orbit Admin Setup:**
- [ ] Install and configure Orbit Admin
- [ ] Connect to Better Auth Admin Plugin for user management

**Dashboard:**
- [ ] Metrics: total users, active bookings, bookings today, bookings this month
- [ ] Sign-up trend chart (last 30 days)

**User Management:**
- [ ] User list — paginated with search by email / name
- [ ] User detail — profile, bookings count, connected calendars, active sessions
- [ ] Ban / Unban user (Better Auth Admin Plugin)
- [ ] Impersonate user (Better Auth Admin Plugin)
- [ ] Revoke all sessions for a user
- [ ] Send password reset email to user

**Booking Oversight:**
- [ ] Platform-wide booking list — filter by date, status, event type
- [ ] Booking detail view — host info, invitee info, timeline

**Job Queue Monitor:**
- [ ] `/admin/jobs` — list of pg-boss jobs (pending, running, failed)
- [ ] Filter by job type
- [ ] Retry failed job button
- [ ] View job error / stack trace

**Platform Settings:**
- [ ] Manage plan features and limits (for future billing integration)
- [ ] Email template preview

**Done when:** Platform admins can access `/admin`, manage users (ban, impersonate), view all bookings, and monitor / retry failed pg-boss jobs.

---

## Phase 19 — QA & Launch Prep

**Goal:** The product is stable, fully tested, and ready for real users.

### Tasks

**End-to-End Testing (manual):**
- [ ] Full host journey: Sign up → Onboarding → Create Event Type → Set Availability → Share Link
- [ ] Full invitee journey: Open booking link → Pick slot → Fill form → Book → Receive confirmation email
- [ ] Reminder emails: confirm 24h and 1h reminder jobs fire at correct times
- [ ] Cancellation flow: cancel via email link → calendar event removed → cancellation email sent
- [ ] Reschedule flow: reschedule via email link → new booking created → old reminder jobs cancelled → new jobs scheduled
- [ ] Double-booking prevention: open same slot in two browser tabs simultaneously, confirm only one succeeds
- [ ] Timezone accuracy: host in EST, invitee in IST — confirm all times display correctly in both timezones
- [ ] Token refresh: let calendar OAuth token expire → confirm Schedica refreshes it silently
- [ ] Calendar sync: add personal event to Google Calendar → confirm slot disappears from booking page within minutes

**Security Checks:**
- [ ] All dashboard routes return 401 for unauthenticated requests
- [ ] Cancel / reschedule tokens are single-use and expire
- [ ] Invitee cannot access another host's bookings via token manipulation
- [ ] Better Auth admin routes return 403 for non-admin users
- [ ] OAuth state parameter validated to prevent CSRF on calendar connect flows
- [ ] Rate limiting on booking creation (prevent spam bookings to a single event type)

**Performance:**
- [ ] Database indexes on: `bookings.hostUserId`, `bookings.startTime`, `bookings.status`, `connected_calendars.userId`, `booking_answers.bookingId`
- [ ] No N+1 queries on dashboard booking list
- [ ] Booking page slot calculation completes in < 500ms
- [ ] Lighthouse score 90+ on booking page (Performance, Accessibility, SEO)

**Pre-Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] `/privacy` page live with real content
- [ ] `/terms` page live with real content
- [ ] `/cookies` page live
- [ ] Email sender domain verified in Resend (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- [ ] Google OAuth app reviewed and not in "Testing" mode
- [ ] Microsoft OAuth app registered for production
- [ ] Zoom OAuth app published (not in development mode)
- [ ] All environment variables set in production
- [ ] pg-boss job workers started on server boot
- [ ] Error monitoring configured (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Create first platform admin account
- [ ] Confirm all pages are mobile-responsive (test on iPhone SE and Galaxy S21)

**Done when:** All manual tests pass, all pre-launch checklist items are complete, the app is deployed to production, and the first real booking can be made end-to-end.

---

## Development Notes

- **Always build mobile-responsive** — booking pages especially must work perfectly on mobile; most invitees will book on their phone
- **Both timezones everywhere** — every email and confirmation screen must show both the invitee's time AND the host's time; this is a key differentiator vs Calendly
- **pg-boss jobs are the source of truth for async work** — never send emails or create calendar events synchronously in the booking API response; always enqueue a job
- **Cancel reminder jobs immediately on cancellation/reschedule** — use `singletonKey` to cancel pending pg-boss jobs when a booking changes; no reminders for meetings that no longer exist
- **Advisory locks for slot booking** — use `pg_advisory_xact_lock` (released on transaction end) to prevent two concurrent bookings claiming the same slot
- **Server Actions over API Routes where possible** — use Next.js Server Actions for dashboard mutations; API Routes for public-facing booking endpoints (invitees are not logged in)
- **Token refresh is silent** — calendar API token refresh must happen invisibly; never show an OAuth re-auth error to an invitee during booking
- **Error states on every async action** — loading state + error state required for every booking form submit, calendar connect, and settings save
