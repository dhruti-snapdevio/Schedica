# Schedica

> A modern, intelligent scheduling platform — built for teams, freelancers, and revenue teams who need more than a simple booking link.

---

## Project Overview

**Schedica** is a web-based appointment scheduling and meeting automation platform. It eliminates the back-and-forth of finding meeting times by letting users share a booking link where others can self-schedule based on real-time calendar availability.

Schedica is inspired by the best of the scheduling market — the simplicity of **Calendly**, the openness of **Cal.com**, the conversion focus of **Chili Piper**, the CRM depth of **HubSpot Meetings**, and the UX innovation of **SavvyCal** — combined into a single, cohesive product.

### Target Users

| Segment | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Freelancers / Solopreneurs | Simple booking links, self-scheduling |
| Sales Teams | Lead routing, round-robin assignment |
| Customer Success | Client onboarding, support call scheduling |
| Recruiters | Interview scheduling, multi-interviewer collective events |
| Consultants / Coaches | Session scheduling, package bookings |
| Enterprises | Team workspaces, SSO, compliance, advanced routing |

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend & Framework

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Next.js 15** (App Router) | React framework — server components, server actions, API routes, SSR/SSG |
| **TypeScript** | Type safety across the entire codebase — frontend, backend, and DB schema |

### Database

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL 16+** | Primary relational database — stores users, event types, bookings, availability, jobs |
| **Drizzle ORM** | TypeScript-first ORM — schema-as-code, type-safe queries, built-in migration runner |

### Background Jobs & Queues

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **pg-boss** | PostgreSQL-backed job queue — schedules and processes async tasks: send reminder emails, sync calendar events, generate video links, and run cron jobs. Uses the same PostgreSQL database — no Redis required. |

> **Two-process architecture:** Schedica runs as two separate processes sharing one PostgreSQL database. The **Next.js server** handles web traffic; the **pg-boss worker** (`pnpm worker`) processes background jobs. In development, `concurrently` starts both. In production, run both as separate pm2/systemd/Docker processes.

> **Why pg-boss over Redis/BullMQ:** pg-boss stores jobs inside PostgreSQL, keeping the infrastructure simple — one fewer service to provision, monitor, and scale. It supports scheduled jobs (cron), retries with exponential backoff, job priorities, and exactly-once delivery. See [jobs-queues.md](./jobs-queues.md) for all 16 job types and the complete feature-to-job mapping.

### Authentication

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Better Auth** | Full-stack authentication library — email/password, Google OAuth, magic links, sessions, 2FA (TOTP), refresh token rotation |
| **Better Auth — Admin Plugin** | Adds an admin API layer: list/ban/impersonate users, manage sessions, view audit logs, revoke tokens — consumed by the custom admin panel |

### Admin Panel

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Custom Next.js Admin** | Hand-built admin pages at `/admin` using Next.js App Router + Shadcn/UI — user management, booking oversight, job queue monitor, platform settings. Protected by Better Auth admin role check. No third-party admin dependency. |

### UI & Styling

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS — all booking page, dashboard, and admin UI styles |
| **Shadcn/UI** | Pre-built accessible component library (buttons, modals, calendars, dropdowns) built on Radix UI primitives — used across dashboard and booking pages |

### External APIs & Calendar Integrations

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Google Calendar API** | Read free/busy events from Google Calendar; write new bookings; auto-generate Google Meet links via `conferenceData` on event creation |
| **Microsoft Graph API** | Read/write Outlook & Office 365 calendars; create Teams meetings via `/onlineMeetings` endpoint |
| **Apple CalDAV / iCloud** *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)* | Read/write iCloud calendars using the CalDAV protocol with an app-specific password — no OAuth required; deferred post-MVP due to protocol complexity |
| **Zoom API (OAuth 2.0)** | Create a unique Zoom meeting room per booking via the Zoom Meetings API |

### Email

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Nodemailer** | SMTP email delivery — connects to any SMTP server (self-hosted or provider); sends booking confirmations, reminders, password resets, cancellation notices |
| **React Email** | Component-based email template rendering — type-safe, styled React components compiled to HTML and passed to Nodemailer for delivery |
| **ical-generator** | Generates RFC 5545-compliant `.ics` calendar invite files — attached to confirmation emails via Nodemailer |

### File Storage

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **@aws-sdk/client-s3** | S3-compatible storage SDK — stores user-uploaded files (profile photos, logos, banners). Works with any S3-compatible provider: AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Spaces. |
| **@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner** | Generates presigned S3 URLs — allows browsers to upload files directly to the storage bucket without routing through the Next.js server |

### Key Libraries

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Zod** | Runtime validation for all API request bodies, form inputs, and environment variables |
| **react-hook-form + @hookform/resolvers** | Performant forms; resolvers integrate Zod validation directly |
| **date-fns** | Date arithmetic — adding/subtracting durations, formatting dates |
| **date-fns-tz** | Timezone-aware date arithmetic using IANA timezone names — DST-safe slot calculation and display |
| **@paralleldrive/cuid2** | Collision-resistant, URL-safe, timestamp-sortable IDs used as primary keys for all app tables |
| **Biome** | Linter + formatter — replaces ESLint + Prettier; 10-50× faster with zero config conflicts |
| **concurrently + tsx** | Dev tooling — `concurrently` runs Next.js server and the pg-boss worker in parallel; `tsx` executes the TypeScript worker directly |

## Post-MVP Technical Planning

When Wave 1 post-launch features are started, these implementation patterns are already designed — based on Krova's production-proven approach. Build these exactly as specified to avoid rework.

---

### Outbound Webhooks

Hosts configure webhook endpoints on their account. Schedica POSTs a signed payload to each endpoint whenever a booking event occurs.

**New database tables:**

```typescript
// src/lib/db/schema/webhooks.ts  (add in Phase 2)

export const outboundWebhooks = pgTable('outbound_webhooks', {
  id:          text('id').primaryKey(),
  hostUserId:  text('host_user_id').notNull().references(() => users.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }),
  url:         text('url').notNull(),               // validated — SSRF-checked before saving
  secret:      text('secret').notNull(),            // random 32-byte hex; used for HMAC signature
  events:      jsonb('events').$type<string[]>().notNull(), // ['booking.created', 'booking.cancelled']
  isActive:    boolean('is_active').notNull().default(true),
  createdAt:   timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
})

export const webhookDeliveries = pgTable('webhook_deliveries', {
  id:            text('id').primaryKey(),
  webhookId:     text('webhook_id').notNull().references(() => outboundWebhooks.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }),
  event:         text('event').notNull(),           // 'booking.created'
  payload:       jsonb('payload').$type<Record<string, unknown>>().notNull(),
  status:        text('status').notNull().default('pending'), // pending | delivered | failed
  httpStatus:    integer('http_status'),            // 200, 404, 500, etc.
  attempts:      integer('attempts').notNull().default(0),
  lastAttemptAt: timestamp('last_attempt_at'),
  createdAt:     timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
})
```

**Events to emit:**

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `booking.created` | Booking confirmed |
| `booking.cancelled` | Booking cancelled (by host or invitee) |
| `booking.rescheduled` | Booking rescheduled to new time |

**SSRF protection — validate URL before saving:**

```typescript
// src/lib/webhook-ssrf.ts
const PRIVATE_RANGES = [
  /^127\./, /^10\./, /^192\.168\./, /^172\.(1[6-9]|2\d|3[01])\./,
  /^::1$/, /^fc[0-9a-f]{2}:/i,
]
const BLOCKED_HOSTS = ['localhost', 'metadata.google.internal']

export function validateWebhookUrl(url: string): { ok: boolean; error?: string } {
  try {
    const parsed = new URL(url)
    if (!['http:', 'https:'].includes(parsed.protocol))
      return { ok: false, error: 'Only http/https allowed' }
    if (BLOCKED_HOSTS.includes(parsed.hostname))
      return { ok: false, error: 'URL points to blocked host' }
    if (PRIVATE_RANGES.some(r => r.test(parsed.hostname)))
      return { ok: false, error: 'URL points to private IP range' }
    return { ok: true }
  } catch {
    return { ok: false, error: 'Invalid URL' }
  }
}
```

**HMAC-SHA256 signature — added to every delivery:**

```typescript
// X-Schedica-Signature: sha256=<hmac>
// Receiver verifies: HMAC(webhookSecret, rawBody) === signature header value

import { createHmac } from 'crypto'

export function signWebhookPayload(secret: string, payload: string): string {
  return 'sha256=' + createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')
}
```

**Delivery job — pg-boss handles retry with backoff:**

```typescript
// Job: WEBHOOK_DELIVER
// retryLimit: 5, retryDelay: 30  (30s → 60s → 120s → 240s → 480s)
// On permanent failure: mark delivery status = 'failed', log to webhook_deliveries
```

---

### Real-Time Dashboard Updates (Pusher / SSE)

When an invitee books while the host has the dashboard open, push the new booking without a page refresh.

**Recommended approach — Server-Sent Events (simpler than Pusher, no external service):**

```typescript
// app/api/stream/bookings/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const session = await requireSession(request)
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    start(controller) {
      // Poll bookings table every 5s and push new rows
      // Or: pg LISTEN/NOTIFY for zero-poll push
    }
  })
  return new Response(stream, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    },
  })
}
```

**Alternative — Pusher** (if SSE proves limiting at scale):
- `pusher` npm package — private channels with `POST /api/pusher/auth` session validation
- Hosted service — no self-hosting; simpler client SDK

> **Decision for Phase 2:** Start with SSE (no external service, simpler). Upgrade to Pusher only if SSE proves insufficient at scale.

---

### Public API Keys (for `/api/v1/*`)

Hosts generate API keys to access Schedica data programmatically (list bookings, check availability, etc.).

**Storage pattern — never store raw keys:**

```typescript
// outbound_api_keys table
export const apiKeys = pgTable('api_keys', {
  id:          text('id').primaryKey(),
  hostUserId:  text('host_user_id').notNull().references(() => users.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }),
  name:        text('name').notNull(),              // "My Integration"
  prefix:      text('prefix').notNull(),            // "sk_live_abc123" — shown to user for identification
  hashedKey:   text('hashed_key').notNull().unique(), // SHA-256 hash of full key — what's stored
  lastUsedAt:  timestamp('last_used_at'),
  createdAt:   timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
  expiresAt:   timestamp('expires_at'),             // null = never expires
})
```

**Key generation and verification:**

```typescript
import { createHash, randomBytes } from 'crypto'

// Generate:
const rawKey = 'sk_live_' + randomBytes(32).toString('hex')   // shown once to user
const hashedKey = createHash('sha256').update(rawKey).digest('hex')  // stored in DB

// Verify on API request:
const incomingHash = createHash('sha256').update(bearerToken).digest('hex')
const keyRow = await db.query.apiKeys.findFirst({ where: eq(apiKeys.hashedKey, incomingHash) })
if (!keyRow) return jsonResponse(401, { error: 'Invalid API key' })
```

## Competitive Landscape

| Product | Strength | Gap Schedica Fills |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Calendly** | Market leader, ease of use | Expensive for teams; dropped Apple Calendar support; shows only one timezone |
| **Cal.com** | Open source, generous free tier | Complex self-hosting; less polished UX |
| **Acuity Scheduling** | Deep appointment customization, built-in payments | Outdated UI; no real-time calendar overlay; weak team routing |
| **Microsoft Bookings** | Native Microsoft 365 integration | No invitee timezone auto-detect; limited customization; tied to Microsoft ecosystem |
| **Chili Piper** | Best-in-class B2B lead routing | Extremely expensive; Salesforce-only; steep learning curve |
| **HubSpot Meetings** | Native CRM integration | Tied to HubSpot; basic features on free tier |
| **SavvyCal** | Best booking UX (calendar overlay) | No free tier; small ecosystem |

**Schedica's positioning:** A polished, open source scheduling platform with SavvyCal-quality UX, Calendly-level features, and Chili Piper-inspired lead routing — free for everyone to use and self-host.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Apple Calendar Support** — Native iCloud/Apple Calendar sync; Calendly dropped this in August 2024
2. **Both Timezones in Every Email** — Confirmation and reminder emails show the invitee's time AND the host's time; Calendly only shows one timezone
3. **Cancellation Policy Enforcement** — Calendly only displays policy text; Schedica actually blocks cancellations within the configured window
4. **Unlimited Custom Questions** — No limits on intake questions; Calendly restricts questions behind paid plans
5. **Multi-Duration Event Types** — One booking link can offer 15, 30, and 60-min options; invitee picks at booking time
6. **Meeting Overload Protection** — Daily meeting limits, buffer times, and minimum notice periods prevent back-to-back burnout
7. **Fully Open Source** — All features free, self-hostable, no paywalls or plan tiers
