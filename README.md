# Schedica

> A modern, intelligent scheduling platform — built for teams, freelancers, and revenue teams who need more than a simple booking link.

---

## Project Overview

**Schedica** is a web-based appointment scheduling and meeting automation platform. It eliminates the back-and-forth of finding meeting times by letting users share a booking link where others can self-schedule based on real-time calendar availability.

Schedica is inspired by the best of the scheduling market — the simplicity of **Calendly**, the openness of **Cal.com**, the conversion focus of **Chili Piper**, the CRM depth of **HubSpot Meetings**, and the UX innovation of **SavvyCal** — combined into a single, cohesive product.

### Target Users

| Segment | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Freelancers / Solopreneurs | Simple booking links, payment collection |
| Sales Teams | Lead routing, CRM sync, round-robin assignment |
| Customer Success | Client onboarding, support call scheduling |
| Recruiters | Interview scheduling, multi-interviewer collective events |
| Consultants / Coaches | Paid sessions, package bookings |
| Enterprises | Team workspaces, SSO, compliance, advanced routing |

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend & Framework

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Next.js 15** (App Router) | React framework — server components, server actions, API routes, SSR/SSG |
| **TypeScript** | Type safety across the entire codebase — frontend, backend, and DB schema |
| **React 19** | UI rendering; server and client components |

### Database

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL 16+** | Primary relational database — stores users, event types, bookings, availability, jobs |
| **Drizzle ORM** | TypeScript-first ORM — schema-as-code, type-safe queries, built-in migration runner |

### Background Jobs & Queues

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **pg-boss** | PostgreSQL-backed job queue — schedules and processes async tasks such as sending reminder emails, syncing calendar events, delivering webhooks, and processing no-show follow-ups. Uses the same Postgres database (no Redis required). |

> **Why pg-boss over Redis/BullMQ:** pg-boss stores jobs inside PostgreSQL, keeping the infrastructure simple — one fewer service to provision, monitor, and scale. It supports scheduled jobs (cron), retries with exponential backoff, job priorities, and exactly-once delivery.

### Authentication

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Better Auth** | Full-stack authentication library — email/password, Google OAuth, Microsoft OAuth, magic links, sessions, 2FA (TOTP), refresh token rotation |
| **Better Auth — Admin Plugin** | Adds an admin API layer: list/ban/impersonate users, manage sessions, view audit logs, revoke tokens — consumed by the Orbit Admin panel |

### Admin Dashboard

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Orbit Admin** | Pre-built admin dashboard UI — user management, system metrics, booking oversight, platform configuration. Sits at `/admin` (protected by Better Auth admin role). |

### UI & Styling

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS — all booking page, dashboard, and admin UI styles |
| **Shadcn/UI** | Pre-built accessible component library (buttons, modals, calendars, dropdowns) built on Radix UI primitives — used across dashboard and booking pages |

### External APIs & Calendar Integrations

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Google Calendar API** | Read free/busy events from Google Calendar; write new bookings; auto-generate Google Meet links via `conferenceData` on event creation |
| **Microsoft Graph API** | Read/write Outlook & Office 365 calendars; create Teams meetings via `/onlineMeetings` endpoint |
| **Apple CalDAV / iCloud** | Read/write iCloud calendars using the CalDAV protocol with an app-specific password — no OAuth required |
| **Zoom API (OAuth 2.0)** | Create a unique Zoom meeting room per booking via the Zoom Meetings API |

### Email & Messaging

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Resend** | Transactional email delivery — booking confirmations, reminders, password resets, cancellation notices |
| **Twilio** | SMS reminders sent to invitees before meetings (post-MVP) |

### Key Libraries

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Zod** | Runtime validation for all API request bodies, form inputs, and environment variables |
| **ical-generator** | Generates RFC 5545-compliant `.ics` calendar invite files — attached to confirmation emails |
| **date-fns-tz** | Timezone-aware date arithmetic using IANA timezone names — DST-safe slot calculation and display |

---

## Core Functionality

Schedica is organized around five core pillars:

### 1. Smart Scheduling
- Create event types (1-on-1, group, round-robin, collective)
- Connect calendars and sync availability in real-time
- Share booking links that auto-update as availability changes

### 2. Team Coordination
- Distribute meetings across team members (round-robin, priority, weighted)
- Require multiple hosts simultaneously (collective)
- Manage team workspaces with admin controls

### 3. Booking Experience
- Customizable booking pages with branding
- Custom intake questions before booking
- Calendar overlay so invitees see mutual availability (inspired by SavvyCal)

### 4. Automation & Workflows
- Automated email and SMS reminders
- Pre-meeting confirmations and post-meeting follow-ups
- Webhook and Zapier triggers for any event

### 5. Revenue & Growth
- Lead qualification routing forms
- Stripe / PayPal payment collection at booking
- CRM sync (HubSpot, Salesforce) with automatic contact creation
- Analytics dashboard to track meeting performance

## Competitive Landscape

| Product | Strength | Gap Schedica Fills |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Calendly** | Market leader, ease of use | Expensive for teams; dropped Apple Calendar support |
| **Cal.com** | Open source, generous free tier | Complex self-hosting; less polished UX |
| **Chili Piper** | Best-in-class B2B lead routing | Extremely expensive; Salesforce-only; steep learning curve |
| **HubSpot Meetings** | Native CRM integration | Tied to HubSpot; basic features on free tier |
| **SavvyCal** | Best booking UX (calendar overlay) | No free tier; small ecosystem |

**Schedica's positioning:** A polished, affordable scheduling platform with SavvyCal-quality UX, Calendly-level features, and Chili Piper-inspired lead routing — at a price accessible to growing teams.



## Project Structure (Planned)

Single Next.js application — frontend, API routes, and server actions all in one repo. No separate API server needed.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Apple Calendar Support** — Native iCloud/Apple Calendar sync; Calendly dropped this in August 2024
2. **Calendar Overlay Booking** — Invitees connect their own calendar and see real mutual availability (SavvyCal-style UX, mainstream reach)
3. **Cancellation Policy Enforcement** — Calendly only shows policy text; Schedica actually enforces cancellation windows
4. **Affordable B2B Lead Routing** — Chili Piper-grade routing (territory, CRM lookup, round-robin) at Calendly-level pricing
5. **AI Notetaker Built-In** — Auto-join, record, transcribe, and summarize every meeting; action items tracked
6. **Multi-CRM Without Lock-In** — HubSpot + Salesforce + Pipedrive natively; not tied to one vendor
7. **Meeting Overload Protection** — Daily/weekly limits, ranked availability, deep-work time blocking
8. **Transparent Pricing** — Per-feature tiers; key features not locked behind per-seat enterprise plans
