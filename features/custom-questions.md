# Custom Questions

Custom Questions allow hosts to collect information from invitees at the time of booking — before the meeting happens. This gives hosts the context they need to make every meeting more productive, and ensures no time is wasted on introductions that could have been answered in advance.

---

## Overview

Every booking form has two default system fields: **Name** and **Email**. Custom Questions let hosts add their own fields on top of these — up to 20 questions per event type — to gather anything from company name and role to specific agenda topics and technical requirements.

Answers are stored with the booking record, included in the host's notification email, visible in the Meetings Dashboard, and can be passed into reminder email templates.

## User Stories

**Host**
- As a host, I want to add custom questions to my booking form, so that I receive the context I need before the meeting starts. *(MVP)*
- As a host, I want to mark questions as required or optional, so that I control which information is mandatory before a booking is confirmed. *(MVP)*
- As a host, I want to choose from multiple question types — text, dropdown, checkbox, phone — so that I can collect structured answers rather than just free text. *(MVP)*
- As a host, I want to see the invitee's answers in my notification email and on the dashboard, so that I can prepare without switching between screens. *(MVP)*
- As a host, I want to pre-fill booking form fields via URL parameters, so that returning visitors do not have to re-enter information I already have. *(MVP)*
- As a host, I want to route invitees to different team members based on their answers, so that the right person handles each type of inquiry. *(Phase 2)*

**Invitee**
- As an invitee, I want the booking form to be short and clearly labeled, so that I can complete it quickly without feeling overwhelmed. *(MVP)*
- As an invitee, I want to see which questions are optional, so that I know what I must fill in versus what I can skip. *(MVP)*

## Question Configuration

For each question, the host can configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Question text | The label shown to the invitee |
| Help text | Smaller description shown below the question (optional context) |
| Required / Optional | Whether invitee must answer before booking |
| Placeholder text | Greyed-out hint inside the input field |

| Character limit | For text fields — max length |

---

## Question Limits

| Plan | Max Questions per Event Type | Calendly Equivalent |
|------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Free** | 3 | Calendly Free: 0 custom questions (none allowed) |
| **Standard** | 10 | Calendly Standard: up to 10 questions |
| **Pro / Teams** | 20 | Calendly Teams: up to 10 questions (Schedica offers more) |

> **Calendly comparison:** Calendly's free plan does not allow any custom intake questions — every field beyond Name and Email requires a paid plan. Schedica's free plan allows 3 custom questions, giving solo users meaningful intake capability without paying.

The default system fields (Name, Email) do not count toward this limit.

---

## Question Order and Layout

- Questions are displayed in the order set by the host
- Drag-and-drop reordering in the event type editor
- Host can preview the booking form at any time to see exactly what invitees see
- Questions appear on a separate form step after the invitee selects a time slot

---

## Pre-Filling Questions

Hosts can pre-fill question answers for specific invitees — useful for embed forms where the host already knows the invitee's data.

### Via URL Parameters
Append question values to the booking URL:
```
https://schedica.com/yourname/30-min-call?a1=Acme+Corp&a2=CEO
```
- `a1` through `a20` correspond to custom question answer fields
- Pre-filled values are editable by the invitee

### Via JavaScript (Embed)
```javascript
window.schedica = {
  url: 'https://schedica.com/yourname/30-min-call',
  prefill: {
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    email: 'jane@acme.com',
    customAnswers: {
      a1: 'Acme Corp',
      a2: 'CEO'
    }
  }
};
```

### Auto-Remember for Repeat Invitees

**Mechanism — email-match lookup (server-side):**
1. When an invitee types their email address into the booking form, Schedica queries the database for previous bookings by the same host with the same invitee email
2. If a previous booking exists: question answers from the most recent booking are pre-filled in the form
3. The invitee can edit any pre-filled answer before submitting — pre-fill is a convenience, not a lock
4. No account or cookie required — the email address is the identifier

**What is pre-filled:**
- Custom question answers from the most recent booking with this host (same `hostUserId` + same `inviteeEmail`)
- Name and phone number fields (if previously provided)
- Email address itself is always pre-filled if the invitee arrives via a pre-fill URL parameter

**What is NOT pre-filled:**
- Answers from a different host's booking form (data is scoped per host)
- Payment details (never pre-filled)

**Privacy note shown to invitee:**
> "We've pre-filled your answers from a previous booking. Update anything that has changed."

This is displayed only when pre-fill has occurred — not shown on first-time bookings.

---

## Where Answers Appear

### Host Notification Email
All question answers are included in the booking notification email sent to the host:

```
New booking: 30-Min Call
Invitee: Jane Smith (jane@acme.com)

Company: Acme Corp
Job Title: CEO
Purpose of call: Product demo
Team size: 45
```

### Meetings Dashboard
- Full question/answer pairs visible in the meeting detail view
- Answers displayed with the original question label for context

### Confirmation Email to Invitee
- Invitee's own answers are included in their confirmation email
- Confirms what they submitted and gives a record for their reference

### Reminder Emails
- Custom question answers can be inserted into reminder email templates via variables:
  - `{answer_1}` through `{answer_20}`
  - Example: "Looking forward to discussing {answer_3} with you tomorrow at {time}!"

### Calendar Invite Description
- Host's calendar invite includes a summary of all question answers in the description field
- Gives host full context when viewing the meeting in Google Calendar / Outlook

## Routing-Compatible Questions

Single Select (radio buttons) and Dropdown questions can be used in routing logic (Phase 2 post-MVP feature):
- Answer maps to a routing destination (specific event type, team member, or rejection)
- Example: "Company size: 1–10" → routes to SMB team; "Company size: 500+" → routes to Enterprise team
- Routing Forms are a dedicated Phase 2 feature (not covered in the MVP feature set)

---

## Question Answer Validation

Client-side and server-side validation:

| Question Type | Validation |
|--------------|-----------|
| Email | Valid email format (RFC 5322) |
| Phone Number | Valid international format |
| URL | Must begin with http:// or https:// |
| Number | Within configured min/max range; numeric only |
| Required fields | Cannot submit form with blank required field |
| Text fields | Stripped of HTML/script tags before saving (XSS prevention) |

---

## Editing Questions After Bookings Exist

- Host can add, edit, or remove questions at any time
- Removing a question: answers from past bookings are preserved in the booking record; question just no longer shown on form
- Changing a question label: old answers remain but are now associated with the new label
- Adding a required question: only applies to new bookings; past bookings unaffected

## Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** — two tables handle questions: `event_type_questions` stores the question definition (type, label, options list, required flag, sort order) per event type; `booking_answers` stores each invitee's answers linked to their booking record. All answers stored as text; multi-select answers stored as a JSON array string.
- **Zod** — validates the entire booking form payload on the server before any database operation: required fields present, email format correct, phone number valid, number within configured min/max range, and all text inputs stripped of HTML to prevent XSS.
- **Next.js App Router** — questions are loaded as part of the event type server query when the booking page renders. Pre-fill via URL parameters (`?a1=value`) is parsed server-side during page render and passed to the form as default values.
- **Shadcn/UI** — provides the drag-and-drop question reorder list in the event type editor, and the form input components (text inputs, radio groups, checkboxes, dropdown selects) on the booking page.
