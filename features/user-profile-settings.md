# User Profile & Settings

The User Profile & Settings page is where hosts manage their personal identity, preferences, and account configuration. It is the control center for everything that defines who the user is within Schedica — their name, photo, timezone, connected calendars, and security settings.

---

## Overview

After onboarding, users need a persistent place to:
- Update their name or profile photo (shown on booking pages)
- Change their timezone (critical for correct availability display)
- Manage which calendars are connected
- Update notification preferences
- Handle security (password, 2FA)

This page is accessed from the top-right user menu → "Profile & Settings" or "Account Settings".

## Danger Zone

Irreversible account actions, separated and clearly marked.

### Delete Account
- "Delete my account" button in red-bordered section
- Confirmation: type "DELETE" to confirm
- What happens:
  - All event types deactivated immediately
  - Existing confirmed bookings: invitees receive cancellation emails
  - Account data deleted within 30 days
  - Users who want a copy of their data before deletion can email support — manual export at MVP scale

### Data Export (GDPR) *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)*

> **MVP decision:** At launch scale (hundreds of users), manual data exports on support request are fully acceptable and legally compliant. The self-serve ZIP export feature (pg-boss job, S3 upload, secure expiring download link, export logic) is meaningful engineering work with near-zero user demand at MVP scale. Calendly itself offers no self-serve export. Build this in Phase 2 when user base justifies it.

**What will be exported (Phase 2):**

| Category | Data Included |
|----------|--------------|
| Profile | Name, email, username, bio, job title, timezone, profile photo |
| Event Types | All event type configurations (name, duration, location, questions, availability rules) |
| Bookings | Full booking history — invitee name, email, time, status, answers, cancellation reason |
| Notifications | Notification preference settings |
| Connected Calendars | Calendar provider names and account emails (tokens are NOT exported) |

**Format (Phase 2):** ZIP file containing JSON files per category (machine-readable) plus a `README.txt` explaining the structure.

**Delivery (Phase 2):** Triggered asynchronously via pg-boss job. Email sent to the account's email address with a secure download link within **24 hours**. Download link expires after 7 days.

**Constraints (Phase 2):**
- Only the account owner can request their own export
- Maximum one export request per 24-hour period
- Invitee data included only where that invitee booked with this host — no cross-host data leakage
- Tokens, passwords, and session data are never included in exports

| `EMAIL_SEND` | Profile photo uploaded, password changed, email changed | Sends confirmation email via email_outbox pattern | MVP |

---

## Audit Logging

Every significant profile mutation writes an immutable audit record inside the same DB transaction as the change.

| Action | When | source | Data Logged |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `user.profile_updated` | Name, display name, job title, company, bio, or website changed | `'web'` | fieldName, oldValue, newValue |
| `user.timezone_changed` | Timezone updated | `'web'` | oldTimezone, newTimezone |
| `user.username_changed` | Booking URL slug changed | `'web'` | oldUsername, newUsername, redirectCreated: true |
| `user.photo_updated` | Profile photo uploaded or removed | `'web'` | S3 key |
| `user.password_changed` | Password change submitted | `'web'` | (no sensitive data — just the event) |
| `user.email_change_requested` | New email submitted; verification pending | `'web'` | newEmail (masked) |
| `user.account_deleted` | Account deletion confirmed | `'web'` | userId, email, deletedAt |
| `calendar.connected` | Calendar OAuth completed | `'web'` | provider, accountEmail |
| `calendar.disconnected` | Calendar disconnect clicked | `'web'` | provider, accountEmail |

All audit records include: `actorId` (the host's own user ID), `actorIp` (request IP), `source: 'web'` (all profile mutations come from Server Actions — none are unauthenticated API calls or background jobs), `createdAt`. See `database-schema.md` for `auditSourceEnum`.

## Tech Stack

- **Better Auth** — manages password changes, 2FA setup (TOTP via authenticator app — Phase 2), active session listing and revocation (Phase 2). The admin plugin lets custom Next.js admin pages view, ban, or impersonate any user account.
- **Next.js App Router** — all settings pages are protected server components. They read the current session via Better Auth and load the user's profile data before rendering — no loading spinner on page open.
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** — stores extended profile fields in a `user_profiles` table (display name, job title, company, bio, website, theme preference, date/time format) and notification preferences in a separate `notification_preferences` table. The `username_redirects` table records old usernames for 30-day redirect support.
- **audit_logs** — every profile mutation (name, timezone, username, photo, password) writes an audit record inside the same DB transaction as the change. Visible to admins in the audit log viewer.
- **S3-compatible storage (@aws-sdk/client-s3 + @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner)** — hosts uploaded profile photos. Works with any S3-compatible provider (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Backblaze B2). The browser uploads directly to the bucket using a presigned URL (generated server-side), so the image never passes through the Next.js server. The stored S3 key is saved in the `user_profiles` table; a public URL is derived from the key.
- **Shadcn/UI** — provides the settings form components: inputs, toggles, dropdowns, avatar upload cropper, and confirmation dialogs (for dangerous actions like account deletion).
- **pg-boss** — used for the GDPR data export job *(Phase 2)*: on request, a job is enqueued that compiles the user's data into a ZIP file, uploads it to S3, and sends a download link via Nodemailer within 24 hours. At MVP, pg-boss is already used for notifications and reminders — the export job is added in Phase 2 without new infrastructure. All job handlers registered with `workMonitored()` — see `jobs-queues.md`.
- **`src/lib/validators.ts`** — profile update Server Actions must run inputs through the centralized validators before Zod: `validateName(fullName)` (returns null if empty/too long/contains control chars), `validateUrl(websiteUrl)` (returns null if not a valid http/https URL). Return `{ error: 'Invalid name' }` immediately if either returns null — do not pass bad input to Zod.
- **Custom Admin Panel** — built with Next.js App Router and Shadcn/UI, powered by the Better Auth Admin Plugin. Platform administrators can view any user's profile, sessions, and account status through a custom-built admin interface.
