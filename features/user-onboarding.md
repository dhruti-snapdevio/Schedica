# User Onboarding

User Onboarding covers the complete authentication and first-run experience — from account creation and sign-in to email verification, password reset, and the guided wizard that takes a new user to their first live booking link. A great onboarding removes friction, builds confidence, and delivers the "aha moment" — the point where the user first understands the product's value.

---

## Overview

Schedica's onboarding has one goal: get the user to a shareable booking link as fast as possible. Every step that doesn't serve that goal is removed.

The full authentication and onboarding sequence covers:
1. Account creation (sign up — email/password, Google OAuth, Microsoft OAuth)
2. Sign in (returning users — email/password, OAuth, magic link)
3. Email verification (6-digit code for email+password sign-ups)
4. Password reset (forgot password → secure email link → new password)
5. Calendar connection
6. Timezone confirmation
7. First event type setup
8. Booking page preview and link share

Target completion time for new user wizard (steps 5–8): **under 3 minutes** for a motivated user.

## User Stories

**New User (Sign Up)**
- As a new user, I want to sign up with Google or Microsoft OAuth, so that I do not have to create and remember a new password. *(MVP)*
- As a new user, I want to sign up with email and password if I prefer not to use OAuth, so that I have full control over my account credentials. *(MVP)*
- As a new user, I want to receive an email verification code immediately after signing up, so that my email address is confirmed before I can start using the app. *(MVP)*
- As a new user, I want my name and photo pre-filled from my Google or Microsoft account, so that I do not have to enter basic profile information manually. *(MVP)*
- As a new user, I want a step-by-step guided setup that takes under 3 minutes, so that I have a shareable booking link the same day I sign up. *(MVP)*
- As a new user, I want to connect my calendar during onboarding, so that my availability is accurate from the very first booking. *(MVP)*
- As a new user, I want to see a live preview of my booking page before sharing it, so that I can confirm it looks right before sending the link to anyone. *(MVP)*
- As a new user, I want to skip optional setup steps and come back to them later, so that I can get to my booking link faster without being blocked by non-essential configuration. *(MVP)*

**Returning User (Sign In)**
- As a returning user, I want to sign in with the same Google or Microsoft account I signed up with, so that I never need a password. *(MVP)*
- As a returning user, I want a "Remember me" option on sign-in, so that I stay logged in for 30 days on my own device without signing in every time. *(MVP)*
- As a returning user, I want to receive a magic link by email if I prefer passwordless sign-in, so that I can access my account without remembering a password. *(MVP)*

**Forgot Password**
- As a user who forgot my password, I want to request a password reset email, so that I can regain access to my account without contacting support. *(MVP)*
- As a user resetting my password, I want the reset link to expire after 60 minutes, so that I know my account is protected if I do not use it immediately. *(MVP)*
- As a user resetting my password, I want all my existing sessions to be signed out after the reset, so that my account is secured if someone else triggered the reset. *(MVP)*

## Step 1 — Account Creation

### Sign-Up Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Google OAuth | One-click signup with Google account; no password needed |
| Microsoft OAuth | One-click signup with Microsoft / Office 365 account |
| Email + Password | Traditional email and password registration |

### Google / Microsoft OAuth Flow
1. User clicks "Sign up with Google" or "Sign up with Microsoft"
2. Redirected to provider's OAuth consent screen
3. User approves Schedica access
4. Returned to Schedica — account created instantly
5. Profile name and photo pre-filled from OAuth provider
6. No email verification step required (email already verified by provider)

### Email + Password Flow
1. User enters name, email address, and password
2. Schedica sends a verification email with a 6-digit code
3. User enters code on verification screen
4. Account created and onboarding continues

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 number or special character
- Strength indicator shown in real-time

### Email Verification Code — Details
- Code is 6 digits, valid for **15 minutes** from the time of sending
- If code expires: "Your verification code has expired. Click here to resend."
- Resend button available after 60 seconds (rate-limited to 3 resends per session)
- Max attempts before lockout: 5 wrong codes → account creation blocked for 10 minutes
- Code is single-use: once entered correctly, it cannot be reused

### Terms and Privacy
- Checkbox: "I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy"
- Required before account creation proceeds
- Links open in new tab (do not interrupt the onboarding flow)

---

## Step 2 — Calendar Connection

The most critical onboarding step. Without a connected calendar, Schedica cannot show real availability or write bookings.

### Calendar Provider Selection Screen
User sees a clean screen with calendar provider options:

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Google Calendar | Most common; recommended for Gmail users |
| Outlook / Office 365 | For Microsoft 365 work and school accounts |
| Apple Calendar / iCloud | For iPhone/Mac users using iCloud calendar |
| Skip for now | Allowed but discouraged — shows a warning |

### OAuth Connection Flow (Google / Outlook)
1. User clicks their calendar provider
2. Opens provider OAuth window
3. User logs in and approves calendar permissions
4. Returned to Schedica — connection confirmed
5. Schedica lists all calendars found on the account
6. User selects:
   - **Which calendars to check for conflicts** (toggle per calendar)
   - **Which calendar to add new bookings to** (radio selection)
7. Connection status shows green: "✓ Google Calendar connected"

### Apple Calendar (iCloud) Connection
1. User clicks "Apple Calendar"
2. Shown instructions: "Go to appleid.apple.com → Security → App-Specific Passwords → Generate"
3. User enters iCloud email and the generated app-specific password
4. Schedica connects via CalDAV and lists available calendars
5. User selects which calendars to check and write to

### Why Calendar Connection Matters (Shown to User)
A brief one-line explanation displayed during this step:
> "Schedica checks your calendar so invitees only see times when you're actually free — no more double bookings."

### Skip Option
- User can skip calendar connection and continue
- Warning shown: "Without a connected calendar, Schedica cannot prevent double-bookings. You can connect your calendar anytime in Settings."
- Booking pages will still work but availability won't reflect real calendar events

---

## Step 3 — Timezone Confirmation

### Auto-Detection
- Schedica detects the user's timezone from their browser automatically
- Shows detected timezone: "We detected your timezone as Asia/Kolkata (IST, UTC+5:30)"
- User confirms with "Yes, that's correct" or changes it

### Manual Selection
- If timezone is wrong or not detected, user selects from a searchable dropdown
- Dropdown includes all IANA timezones with city names
- Current time preview updates as user selects: "Your current time: 3:45 PM"

### Why It Matters (Shown to User)
> "Your timezone ensures your availability is shown correctly to people around the world."

---

## Step 4 — First Event Type Setup

Guided creation of the user's first event type. Keeps it simple — only the essential fields, with smart defaults pre-filled.

### Fields Shown in Onboarding (Simplified)

| Field | Default | User Action |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Event name | "30-Minute Meeting" | Edit or keep |
| Duration | 30 minutes | Select from: 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / Custom |
| Location | Google Meet (if Google connected) | Select location type |
| Available hours | Mon–Fri, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM | Confirm or adjust |

### What Is Hidden During Onboarding
Advanced settings are hidden to avoid overwhelming new users:
- Buffer times
- Minimum notice period
- Custom questions
- Booking window
- Date overrides

These are accessible after onboarding from the Event Type settings.

### Availability Preview
After confirming hours, a mini calendar preview shows the first few available slots. This gives instant visual confirmation that the setup is working correctly.

---

## Step 5 — Booking Page Preview and Share

The final onboarding step shows the user their live booking page and gives them their link.

### Booking Page Preview
- Full-screen preview of the booking page as an invitee would see it
- Shows host name, profile photo, event type name, duration, and available slots
- "This is what your invitees will see" label

### Your Booking Link
- Displays the user's booking URL: `schedica.com/yourname/30-minute-meeting`
- **Copy Link** button — one click to copy to clipboard
- **Share via Email** — opens default email client with link pre-filled
- **Share on LinkedIn** — opens LinkedIn share dialog (optional)

### "You're all set!" Confirmation
- Checkmark animation and "You're ready to accept bookings!"
- Clear CTA: "Go to Dashboard" — takes user to the main Schedica dashboard

---

## Post-Onboarding: Dashboard First Visit

First time on the dashboard after onboarding, user sees a brief checklist of recommended next steps:

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| ✅ Connect your calendar | Done during onboarding |
| ✅ Create your first event type | Done during onboarding |
| ☐ Add a profile photo | Link to Profile Settings |
| ☐ Share your booking link | Link to copy booking URL |
| ☐ Set up a reminder email | Link to Notifications settings |

Checklist dismissible once all steps complete or manually dismissed.

---

## Re-Onboarding (Returning Incomplete Users)

If a user signed up but didn't finish onboarding (e.g., closed the tab after Step 2):
- On next login, shown a "Continue setup" banner on the dashboard
- Banner shows which step was last completed
- "Continue" button resumes from the incomplete step

---

## Onboarding Progress Indicator

Throughout onboarding, a progress bar or step indicator is shown:

```
Step 1 of 5: Connect your calendar
[●●●○○]
```

- Shows current step and total steps
- Clicking a previous step allows going back
- No skipping forward (steps must be completed in order, except the optional "skip calendar" path)

---

## Error States During Onboarding

| Error | Message Shown | Recovery |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| OAuth denied (user cancelled) | "Calendar not connected. You can connect later in Settings." | Continue without calendar |
| Google account already registered | "An account already exists with this Google account. Sign in instead." | Link to sign in |
| Email already registered | "That email is already registered. Sign in or reset your password." | Link to sign in / forgot password |
| Calendar connection failed (API error) | "We couldn't connect your calendar. Try again or skip for now." | Retry or skip |
| iCloud app-specific password wrong | "Incorrect app-specific password. Please try again." | Retry with correct password |
| Verification code expired | "Your code has expired. Please request a new one." | Resend code |
| Verification code wrong (5× attempts) | "Too many incorrect attempts. Please wait 10 minutes." | Wait and retry |

---

## Authentication — Sign-In Flow (Returning Users)

Sign-in is separate from onboarding but lives on the same `/sign-in` page. Returning users are routed here after their first session.

### Sign-In Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Google OAuth | "Sign in with Google" — one click, no password |
| Microsoft OAuth | "Sign in with Microsoft" — one click, no password |
| Email + Password | Enter registered email and password |
| Magic Link (passwordless) | Enter email → receive a one-click sign-in link via email |

### Email + Password Sign-In Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. Schedica verifies credentials server-side (bcrypt password comparison)
3. On success: session created; user redirected to dashboard
4. On failure: "Incorrect email or password" (no indication which is wrong — security best practice)

### Google / Microsoft OAuth Sign-In Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft"
2. Redirected to provider's OAuth screen (provider may remember the user, making this one-click)
3. On success: Schedica matches the OAuth email to an existing account
4. If no account found: "No account found with this Google account. Sign up instead." — link to sign-up

### Magic Link (Passwordless) Sign-In Flow
1. User clicks "Email me a sign-in link"
2. Enters their registered email address
3. Schedica sends an email with a secure one-click link (valid for 10 minutes, single-use)
4. User clicks the link → instantly signed in; link immediately invalidated
5. If link is expired: "This sign-in link has expired. Request a new one." → re-enter email
6. Use case: User forgot their password; user prefers not to manage passwords; shared/public device where typing a password is inconvenient

### Remember Me
- Checkbox on the sign-in form: "Remember me on this device"
- **Checked (default on trusted devices):** Session persists for 30 days; no re-login required
- **Unchecked:** Session expires when browser is closed (session cookie)
- Sessions are stored server-side; "Remember me" sets a durable refresh token in a secure `HttpOnly` cookie

---

## Forgot Password / Password Reset

For email+password users who have forgotten their password.

### Reset Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot your password?" on the sign-in page
2. Enters their registered email address
3. If email exists: password reset email sent immediately
4. If email not found: same success message shown ("Check your inbox") — prevents email enumeration
5. User receives email with a **secure one-time reset link** (valid for 60 minutes)
6. User clicks link → taken to "Set New Password" page
7. Enters new password (meets requirements) + confirms it
8. On success: password updated; all existing sessions invalidated; user signed in automatically
9. Confirmation: "Your password has been reset. You're now signed in."

### Reset Email Contents
- Subject: "Reset your Schedica password"
- Body: "We received a request to reset your password. Click the button below within 60 minutes."
- Large "Reset Password" button with the secure token link
- "If you didn't request this, you can safely ignore this email."
- No password shown in the email

### Reset Link Security
- Token is a cryptographically random 256-bit string (URL-safe base64)
- Stored as a hash in the database (not the raw token)
- Single-use: consumed on first visit to the reset page
- Expires after 60 minutes regardless of use
- On expiry: "This link has expired. Request a new password reset."

### Password Reset Limits
- Maximum 3 reset requests per email per hour (rate-limited to prevent abuse)
- If limit reached: "Too many reset requests. Please try again in 1 hour."

---

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) — Login Challenge

When a user has 2FA enabled (configured in [user-profile-settings.md](user-profile-settings.md)), the login flow adds a second step.

### Login with 2FA — TOTP (Authenticator App)
1. User enters email + password (or signs in via OAuth)
2. Credentials are valid → instead of proceeding to dashboard, shown a 2FA challenge screen
3. Screen shows: "Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app"
4. User opens Google Authenticator / Authy, finds the Schedica entry
5. Enters the current 6-digit TOTP code (regenerates every 30 seconds)
6. On valid code: session created; user enters dashboard
7. On invalid code: "Incorrect code. Please try again." (up to 5 attempts)
8. After 5 failed attempts: account locked for 15 minutes

### Login with 2FA — Backup Code
- "Can't access your authenticator app?" link on the 2FA challenge screen
- User enters one of their 8 downloaded backup codes
- Backup codes are one-time use: used code is immediately invalidated
- On valid backup code: session created; warning shown: "You used a backup code. You have X codes remaining. Consider regenerating your backup codes."
- If all backup codes are used: user must contact support for account recovery

### 2FA — SMS (Post-MVP)
1. After valid password: "We sent a code to your phone ending in \*\*\*\*1234"
2. User enters 6-digit SMS code
3. Code valid for 5 minutes; resend available after 60 seconds
4. On valid code: session created

### Trusted Devices
- After successful 2FA login, option: "Trust this device for 30 days"
- If trusted: 2FA challenge skipped on this device for 30 days
- Trusted device list visible and revocable in Profile & Settings → Security → Active Sessions

---

## Session Management

### Session Lifecycle

| Event | Behavior |
|-------|---------|
| Sign in (remember me on) | Session valid 30 days; refresh token rotates on use |
| Sign in (remember me off) | Session ends when browser closes |
| Session expiry | Redirect to sign-in page with message: "Your session has expired. Please sign in again." |
| Password changed | All existing sessions invalidated immediately |
| 2FA enabled/disabled | All existing sessions invalidated (security measure) |
| Account deleted | All sessions invalidated immediately |

### Refresh Token Rotation
- Access token: short-lived (15 minutes)
- Refresh token: long-lived (30 days with "remember me")
- Every time the refresh token is used to get a new access token, the refresh token itself is rotated (new one issued, old one invalidated)
- If a rotated (old) refresh token is seen: potential token theft detected → all sessions invalidated + security alert email sent to user

### Active Sessions (Managed in Settings)
- List of all active sessions in Profile & Settings → Security
- Each session shows: device type, browser, approximate location, last active
- User can individually sign out any session
- "Sign out all other devices" button

---

## Account Lockout & Security

### Failed Login Attempts
- After **5 consecutive failed password attempts** for the same email: account temporarily locked
- Lock duration: **15 minutes** (exponential backoff on repeat lockouts)
- User notified via email: "We noticed several failed sign-in attempts. Your account is temporarily locked."
- Email includes: time of attempts, approximate IP/location, link to reset password if this wasn't them

### Rate Limiting
| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Sign-in attempts | 10 per minute per IP |
| Password reset requests | 3 per hour per email |
| Magic link requests | 3 per hour per email |
| Verification code resend | 3 per 30-minute window |
| 2FA code attempts | 5 per login session |

### Suspicious Login Detection
- If a login comes from an unrecognized device or location: email alert sent to the account owner
- Email: "New sign-in detected — [Device, Browser, Location]. If this was you, no action needed."
- If it wasn't them: "Secure my account" link → forces password reset and signs out all sessions

### OAuth Account Linking
When a user tries to sign in with a social provider but the same email already exists in Schedica via a different method:
- **Email account + tries Google OAuth with same email:** "An account exists with this email. Sign in with your email and password, then connect Google in Settings."
- **Google OAuth account + tries Microsoft OAuth with same email:** "An account exists with this email via Google. Sign in with Google or use a different email."
- Accounts are NOT auto-merged to prevent account takeover attacks

---

## Logout

### Sign Out
- Available from the top-right user menu → "Sign out"
- Action: current session token invalidated server-side; access + refresh cookies cleared
- Redirected to the sign-in page
- No confirmation dialog for single sign-out (immediate)

### Sign Out All Devices
- Available in Profile & Settings → Security → "Sign out of all devices"
- Requires password confirmation before executing
- All sessions and refresh tokens invalidated
- Useful when: device lost or stolen, suspected account compromise

## Tech Stack

- **Better Auth** — handles all sign-up methods (email/password, Google OAuth, Microsoft OAuth), email verification codes, session creation, and account lockout. The admin plugin exposes user management to Orbit Admin.
- **Next.js App Router** — onboarding is a 5-step wizard built as sequential pages. Middleware checks `onboardingDone` on each request and redirects incomplete users back to their current step.
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** — stores the user account, current `onboardingStep`, and `onboardingDone` flag. Drizzle schema extends Better Auth's built-in users table with Schedica-specific fields (username, timezone, onboarding progress).
- **pg-boss** — schedules a welcome email job immediately after signup to be delivered asynchronously without blocking the onboarding response.
- **Resend** — delivers the email verification code during sign-up and the welcome email after onboarding completes.
- **React Email** — renders the verification code email, password reset email, and welcome email as styled React components compiled to HTML before sending via Resend.
- **@upstash/ratelimit** — enforces rate limits on sign-in, password reset, and magic link endpoints to prevent brute-force and abuse.
