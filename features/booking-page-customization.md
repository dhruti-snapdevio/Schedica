# Booking Page Customization

The booking page is the invitee's first impression of Schedica. Customization allows hosts and organizations to make booking pages feel like a natural extension of their brand — not a third-party tool.

---

## Overview

Every event type has a publicly accessible booking page. Above that, every host also has a **Profile Overview Page** listing all their event types. MVP customization covers brand color, logo, profile photo, and custom confirmation messages. Custom domain and full white-labeling are Phase 4 features. The booking page must communicate trust and professionalism while remaining simple and fast to use.

## Profile Overview Page

The profile overview page is the host's "home" page — it shows all active event types in one place. Every host gets a URL like `schedica.com/yourname` that lists all their available event types.

### What Is On the Profile Page
- Host's name and profile photo
- Job title and company (optional)
- Short bio or welcome message
- All **active** (non-hidden) event types displayed as cards
- Each card shows: event type name, duration, brief description, color
- Hidden/secret event types are never shown here

### Profile Page Customization
- **Introductory text / headline:** Short welcome message shown above event types (e.g., "Thanks for visiting — pick a meeting type below")
- **Event type order:** Drag-and-drop reorder; appears in the same order for invitees
- **Color coding:** Each event type shows its assigned color as a visual accent
- **Branding:** Logo and brand color applied across the profile page
- **Remove Schedica branding:** "Powered by Schedica" badge removed on paid plans

### Event Type Card Contents (Profile Page)
Each card on the profile page shows:
- Color indicator (left border or card accent)
- Event type name
- Duration (e.g., "30 min")
- Location type icon (camera icon for video, phone icon for call, pin for in-person)
- Short description (first 80 characters of the event description)
- "Book" or "Select" CTA button

### Profile Page Behavior
- Clicking an event type card opens that event type's booking calendar
- Back button returns to the profile overview
- Profile page is publicly accessible — no login required for invitees
- If the host has only one active event type: profile page can redirect directly to that event type (optional setting)

## Booking Page URL Structure

| URL Type | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Personal | `schedica.com/username` |
| Specific Event | `schedica.com/username/event-slug` |
| Team Page | `schedica.com/org/team-name` |
| Custom Domain | `meetings.company.com/john` |
| Custom Domain + Event | `meetings.company.com/john/30-min-call` |

### URL Customization
- Choose username slug during onboarding
- Customize event-type slug per event type
- Both username and event slug can be changed (with redirect from old URL)

---

## Booking Page Preview

Before publishing, hosts can preview their booking page:
- See exactly what invitees will see
- Preview across device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Test the form without creating a real booking
- Check email templates with "Send Preview Email" option

---

## Responsive Design

All booking pages are fully responsive:
- Optimized for mobile (iPhone, Android)
- Tablet-friendly layout
- Fast load times (< 1 second target)
- Accessible: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Works with screen readers

---

## Booking Page Language

The booking page UI (button labels, date/time formatting, system text) can be displayed in different languages for international invitees.

### Supported Languages
- English (default)
- Spanish (Español)
- French (Français)
- German (Deutsch)
- Portuguese (Português)
- Italian (Italiano)
- Dutch (Nederlands)
- Japanese (日本語)
- Chinese Simplified (中文)
- Hindi (हिन्दी)
- Arabic (عربي) — RTL layout supported

### What Gets Translated
- All system-generated UI text: button labels, date picker, timezone selector, confirmation message
- Default email confirmation text
- Error messages

### What Does NOT Get Translated
- Event type name (set by host — must be translated manually)
- Event type description (set by host)
- Custom intake questions (set by host)
- Any custom text entered by the host

### Language Configuration
- Set per event type (not globally, to allow different event types in different languages)
- Example: One event type in English for US clients, clone in Spanish for LATAM clients
- No automatic language detection — language is fixed per event type
- Invitee cannot manually switch language on the booking page

### Multi-Language Strategy
To support multiple languages:
1. Create the event type in primary language
2. Clone the event type
3. Change language setting on the clone
4. Translate all custom text (name, description, questions) manually
5. Share the appropriate language link with the relevant audience

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js App Router dynamic routes** — public booking pages use `[username]` and `[username]/[eventSlug]` dynamic segments. These are React Server Components, so the full page (host info, branding, event type details) is rendered on the server — fast initial load, no layout shift.
- **Next.js ISR (on-demand revalidation)** — booking pages are cached at the CDN edge. When the host updates their branding, event type, or availability, `revalidatePath` is called server-side to instantly push a fresh version — no stale booking pages visible to invitees.
- **Next.js Metadata API** — each booking page auto-generates SEO-optimised `<title>`, `<description>`, and Open Graph tags using the host's name and event type details.
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** — branding settings (logo URL, banner URL, primary colour, confirmation message, remove-branding flag) are stored in a `user_branding` table. Loaded as part of the booking page server query.
- **Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI** — booking page layout, colour theming (primary colour applied via CSS variable from the host's brand colour), and all interactive elements (date picker, slot grid, form inputs, confirmation screen).
